        <h2>1. Purpose of these Terms</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms and Conditions (the “Agreement”) set out the obligations,
          responsibilities, and rights of both the Photographer and the Client
          regarding the handling, sharing, and protection of photographs and

        </p>

        <h2>2. Obligations of the Photographer</h2>
        <p>The Photographer agrees to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Process all personal data lawfully, fairly, and transparently in
            accordance with GDPR requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Share photographs exclusively with the Client named in the consent
            form and with no other party unless the Client provides explicit
            written authorisation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Never sell, trade, publish, or otherwise disclose any personal data
            or images to third parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Immediately delete all photographs and personal data once the Client
            has confirmed successful receipt, unless retention is legally
            required or expressly authorised by the Client.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to
            ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of all personal
            data.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Obligations of the Client</h2>
        <p>The Client agrees to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide accurate and truthful personal information.</li>
          <li>
            Review and confirm receipt of the delivered photographs in a timely
            manner.

            copies of the photographs once delivered.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Client Rights under GDPR</h2>
        <p>The Client retains all rights afforded under applicable data protection laws, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The right to access their personal data.</li>
          <li>The right to request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
          <li>The right to request deletion of their personal data.</li>
          <li>The right to withdraw consent at any time.</li>
          <li>The right to be informed of how their data is used and protected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Collected</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>6. Delivery of Photos</h2>
        <p>
          Photographs shall be delivered securely via a mutually agreed method,
          including but not limited to device‑to‑device transfer or encrypted
          local sharing. No cloud storage or third‑party service will be used
          without the Client’s explicit consent.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          All photographs and related personal data will be stored only until
          the Client confirms successful receipt. Following confirmation, the
          Photographer will irreversibly delete all files unless the Client
          explicitly provides written permission for retention.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
          The Photographer will adopt reasonable and proportionate technical and
          organisational measures to safeguard personal data, including secure
          devices, access controls, and encrypted sharing methods.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Third‑Party Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          Personal data and photographs will not be shared with or disclosed to
          any third party unless required by law or explicitly authorised by the
          Client in writing.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By proceeding with the photography session and providing consent, both
          the Photographer and the Client acknowledge and agree to be bound by
          the terms set out in this Agreement.
